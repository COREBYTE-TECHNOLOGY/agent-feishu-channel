 *
 * `interrupt()` MUST be idempotent — the state machine may call it
 * during the narrow window between a result message arriving and the
 * iterator ending naturally, and we don't want the second call to
 * throw or spawn a second signal.
 *
 * `interrupt()` resolves only after the turn has fully settled (child
 * exited / iterator ended), so the state machine can safely assume
 * that once the returned Promise resolves, no more messages will be
 * emitted for this turn.
 *
 * `setPermissionMode()` mirrors the SDK's `query.setPermissionMode`
 * and changes the default permission policy for the REMAINING tool
 * calls in this turn. Used to implement the "本轮 acceptEdits" button:
 * the session flips the mode mid-turn so subsequent Edit/Write tool
 * uses are auto-allowed without re-prompting. Idempotent; calling
 * with the current mode is a no-op.
